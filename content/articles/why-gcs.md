## Why start this group?
There's a lot of conversation to be had here.

The long and short of it is, the game industry, up to now, has not had a group dedicated to cinematography!

There are many reasons for this. The market has been evolving continuously, the technology was not always in a place to deliver "cinematic" images, and even the idea of cinematography is an ill-defined and inconsistently-applied idea within studios worldwide.

## What can this group do about it?

To be determined.

Sometimes it's easier to start walking a path without knowing where you're going, than to stand by in paralysis because you can't pre-visualize the destination. Interviews of industry professionals, explorations of novel workflows, and general collaboration are all parts of the puzzle.

## What is the group, exactly?

A small, invite-only collection of industry professioals with a stake in cinematography in the games industry. What it means to be a member, and how the group connects with the greater industry, as well as the general public, is still being discussed. If you'd like to be considered, head to our <a href="/about">about</a> page.

## Who are you?

I'm Ryan. You can find more info about me on my <a href="https://twitter.com/poly_rhythm">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanjjones/">LinkedIn</a>.

I'm a lighting artist, technical artist, washed up graphics engineer, and enthusiastic voyeur of light. I also really like movies. And I guess cinematography is okay.
