The Game Cinematographer Society started in 2021 as an invite-only group, with an objective of defining and advancing cinematography within the game industry.

Members span the range from Cinematics Directors, Lighting Artists, Environment Artists, Directors of Photography, and, of course, Cinematographers.

The group is newly-founded and thus still assembling rules and operating procedures. We're currently not looking to expand our membership just yet, but if you have questions or believe you are a perfect fit for such a group, please email us <a href="mailto:ryan@gcsoc.org">here</a>.
