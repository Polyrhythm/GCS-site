The Game Cinematographer Society started in 2021 as an invite-only group, with an objective of defining and advancing cinematography within the game industry.

Members span the range from Cinematics Directors, Lighting Artists, Environment Artists, Directors of Photography, and, of course, Cinematographers.

The group is newly-founded and thus still assembling rules and operating procedures. If you're interested in knowing more or joining, please email us <a href="mailto:ryan@gcsoc.org">here</a>.
