[{"categories":["Article"],"contents":"Why start this group? There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of conversation to be had here.\nThe long and short of it is, the game industry, up to now, has not had a group dedicated to cinematography!\nThere are many reasons for this. The market has been evolving continuously, the technology was not always in a place to deliver \u0026ldquo;cinematic\u0026rdquo; images, and even the idea of cinematography is an ill-defined and inconsistently-applied idea within studios worldwide.\nWhat can this group do about it? To be determined.\nSometimes it\u0026rsquo;s easier to start walking a path without knowing where you\u0026rsquo;re going, than to stand by in paralysis because you can\u0026rsquo;t pre-visualize the destination. Interviews of industry professionals, explorations of novel workflows, and general collaboration are all parts of the puzzle.\nWhat is the group, exactly? A small, invite-only collection of industry professioals with a stake in cinematography in the games industry. What it means to be a member, and how the group connects with the greater industry, as well as the general public, is still being discussed. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to be considered, head to our about page.\nWho are you? I\u0026rsquo;m Ryan. You can find more info about me on my Twitter or LinkedIn.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a lighting artist, technical artist, washed up graphics engineer, and enthusiastic voyeur of light. I also really like movies. And I guess cinematography is okay.\n","permalink":"gcsoc.org/articles/why-gcs/","tags":["blog","article"],"title":"On starting the GCS"}]
